## Permutation compostition calculator
* Input the alphabet in a space separate line
* Input the first permuation group, and each element is in cycle representation. Elements are separated by spaces.
* Input the second permutation group
* Example:
  * input 1 = {(12),(34)}, input 2 = {(56),(78)}, output = {(12)(56),(12)(78),(34)(56),(34)(78)}
  * Notice the permutation composition is from right to left
